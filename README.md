This is a regular meetup for JavaScript developers to go climbing while debating the finer points of asynchronous flow control. It takes place every Tuesday evening after work at either:

* [The Reach](http://www.thereach.org.uk) in Woolwich
* [Buliding One](http://archclimbingwall.com/building-1/) at the Biscuit Factory in Bermondsey
* [Vauxwall](http://archclimbingwall.com/building-1/) in the railway arches underneath Vauxhall overground

Climbing is around Â£10 per session plus a few quid for shoes if you don't have them.

Please visit the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/climbingjs/london) to find out where the next one is!
