This is a regular meetup for JavaScript developers to go climbing while debating the finer points of asynchronous flow control. It takes place every Tuesday evening after work at [Buliding One](http://archclimbingwall.com/building-1/) at the Biscuit Factory in Bermondsey.

Climbing costs £10 per visit or £20 for a one-off [introductory session](http://archclimbingwall.com/lessons/introduction-lesson/) - recommended for beginners.  Fees include equiment hire.  Free drop-in sessions for improvers are also run on the night.

If you have any questions please visit the gitter chat room or open an [issue](./issues).
